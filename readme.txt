== Settings ==

Go to Settings > Wash Care Symbols for WooCommerce.

* **Position:** Inside "Additional Information"(default) / below short description (added in 2.4) / In custom tab (added in 3.1).
* **Layout:** Horizontal/Vertical/Minimal (added in 2.2).
* **Icons size** (added in 2.7).

== Shortcode ==

If for some reason, you don't want to use WooCommerce Product data tabs, you can display wash/care instructions wherever you want with the `[wcsfwc]` shortcode.

In a product page, just do:

~~~php
[wcsfwc]
~~~

It will use current product and the layout you defined in Settings.

If you want to override layout, add a "layout" argument (available values are "minimal", "vertical", "horizontal"):

`
[wcsfwc layout="minimal"]
`

If you want to display the wash/care instructions outside a product page, or for another product, use "product" argument:

`
[wcsfwc product="123"]
`

In a .php file, use the `do_shortcode` function:

`
echo do_shortcode( '[wcsfwc]' );
`

== Hooks ==

* `wcsfw_display` (action): allows you to use your own display hook
* `wcsfw-data` (filter): allows you to modify symbols data and texts
* `wcsfw_below_short_desc_priority` (filter): allows you to change hook priority if symbols doesn't appear in the right place when using *below short description* setting
* `wcsfw_custom_tab_priority` (filter): allows you to change tabs order when using *custom tab* layout

== How to Customize ==

**Remove hooks**

In order to remove hooks used by this plugin, you'll need to get plugin instance and pass it in an array inside the callback argument.
For example:

~~~php
$wcsfwc = WCSFWC\WashCareSymbolsForWooCommerce::get_instance();
remove_action( 'woocommerce_single_product_summary', [ $wcsfwc, 'below_short_desc_display' ], apply_filters( 'wcsfw_below_short_desc_priority', 21 ) );
remove_action( 'woocommerce_product_additional_information', [ $wcsfwc, 'additional_info_display' ] );
~~~

**Display wherever you want**

Here is what you'll need to use a custom hook to display instructions wherever you want on your product page:

~~~php
add_action('whatever_hook_you_want', function(){
    $wcsfwc = WCSFWC\WashCareSymbolsForWooCommerce::get_instance();
    $wcsfwc->additional_info_display();
});
~~~
